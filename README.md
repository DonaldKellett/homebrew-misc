Miscellaneous utilities authored and/or packaged for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by Donald Sebastian Leung, for both macOS and Linux where applicable.

## Installing

Add the tap as follows:

```bash
$ brew tap DonaldKellett/misc
```

Then search for and install formulae as usual.

## Contributing

Issue reports for existing formulae are welcome. See also [issues labelled with "help wanted"](https://github.com/DonaldKellett/homebrew-misc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) to see how you could contribute to resolving them. Pull requests addressing bugs in existing formulae are generally welcome, but remember to keep in mind that formulae should work (or fail gracefully) on both macOS and Linux platforms. If in doubt, open an issue to seek for approval from the tap maintainer.

For Linux, the reference distribution is Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
